## ‚úçüèª Topic 1: CSS Text

In this topic we will learn about some text properties such as styling, spacing,
family, color, and size.

### Text Styling

- _Font Weight:_ it sets the thickness of the character. In CSS, `font-weight` is
  a property and `bold` is a value (i.e. `font-weight: bold`). Although you can
  use name values like `bold` or `normal`, it is better to use numerical values
  which range from `100 - 900`. Note that for value `<= 400` the value is normal
  while `500` and `600` are for medium weights and anything above `700` is `bold`.
  
  __Font-weight guidance:__ Headings should be between 500-900 while normal text
  should be 300-400. This high contrast in the font-weight will make the headings
  draw more attention.
- _Text Decorative:_ it sets decorative lines on text. The property name is
  `text-decoration` and its values include:
  - _Line value:_ `none`, `underline`, `overline`, `line-through`
  - _Color value:_ `named`, `hex`, `rgb`
  - _Style value:_ `double`, `dotted`, `wavy`, `solid`, `dashed`
  
  An example of this can be:
  ```css
  text-decoration: underline red dotted;
  ```
  Not recommended to use, unless you want to remove the default `underline` value
  on anchor links.
- _Font Style:_ it sets the style of a font. Its values include: `normal`, `italic`,
  `oblique`, `oblique 10deg`. It can sometimes be used to draw attention.
- _List Style:_ it sets the style of the list. Its values include:
  - `none`: Always us this for structural purposes (e.g. navigation bar)
  - `disc`
  - `circle`
  - `square`
  - `decimal`: This is the default for order list.

### Text Spacing

- _Text Align:_ specifies the horizontal alignment of text within an element.
  There are 4 values to choose from: `left`, `right`, `center`, and `justify`.
  But note that, only <ins>block</ins> text can move around, because it takes all
  the horizontal space of the screen. You can take a look at this picture
  ![Block-vs-Inline-Text](./assets/Block-vs-Inline-Text-Spacing.png)
  _Text align guidance:_ Don't justify text, long block of text should be left-
  aligned and do not center large blocks of text.
- _Line height:_ sets the height of text and is commonly used to set distance
  between multiple lines of text. The signature is as follows:
  ```css
  // There are several types of values: unitless, percentage, pixels, ems
  line-height: 1.5; 
  ```
  Headings should be `< 1.5` and regular text should be `1.5-2` to improve 
  readability.
- _Letter spacing:_ sets the horizontal space between characters. The signature
  is
  ```css
  // There are 3 main units that can be used: pixels (most common), percentage, and ems.
  letter-spacing: 8px;
  ```
  We __often__ apply a small negative px value to headings to improve readability,
  which is commonly called _tightening_.

### Text Size

- _Font Size:_ sets the font size of the text. The values can be set to be either
  __static__ or __relative__. Let's first know the signature of the property:
  ```css
  font-size: 16px; // Static value.
  ```
  - __Absolute units:__ size is fixed and does not change in relation to parent
    elements. The units to be used are flexible:
    - px (most commonly used)
    - pt, in, cm, mm
  - __Relative units:__ size is based on the size of the parent element and adjusts
    proportionally to changes in the parent elements. Some units for the values are:
    - %, em, rem, vh, vw

  __Font Size Guidance:__ It is recommended that regular text should be `16px-32px`
  and headings can be `>60px`. We can use a type-scale [‚á≤](typescale.com)
  which provides a structured hierachy of font sizes to create visual consistency
  and limits choices.

### Font Family

- _Typeface:_ There are 5 types - serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, and display.
  - Serif: A classic feel used by brands to communicate __luxury__ and __reliability__.
    They are mostly used by _high-end companies_.
  - Sans-serif: A modern and clean feel used by brands to communicate __simplicity__
    and __clarity__. Thus, they are used by many _tech companies_.
  - Monospace: A technical feel used by brands to communicate __accuracy__ and
    __precision__. Usually, they are used for very technical products.
  - Cursive: A personal feel used to connect with people on a more emotional level.
    Some web pages related to weddings or blogs often use cursive.
- _Font Family:_ sets a prioritized list of font names (typeface) or font categories.
  ```css
  //            1st choice
  font-family: 'Tahoma', sans-serif;
  //                     Fall-back
  ```
  Consider the above piece of code, the way it works is that fonts will only display
  if they are installed on local machines.
  
  __Font guidance:__ Select 1 or 2 fonts, no more.
  
  _Google Fonts_ are available online and do not rely on the fonts installed on
  an individual user's device.

### Text Color

- _CSS Color:_ specifies the color of text. Its signature is as follows
  ```css
  color: #9874F9;
  ```
  
  The value for the `color` property can have different units:
  - hex (most commonly used)
  - rgb, rgba, hsl
  
  __Color Guidance:__ Have at least 2 colors in your color palette, a primary and
  grey color.
  ![Text-Color-Guidance](./assets/Text-Color-Guidance.png)
  Primary colors are used to highlight important parts of a page (e.g. buttons). 
  Tints and shades can be used to create contrast, which are often used for fonts.
  
  A great place to explore colors and choose you palette is [tailwind colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors).
