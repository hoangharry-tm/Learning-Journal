<h2 id="Chap-1">🐣 Chapter 1: <i>What and why are shares?</i></h2>

- _Quoted shares_ are shares of the company that are published on stock exchange.
- The companies described as _blue chip_ are the largest, safest businesses on the
  stock market. Regardless, they're not completely safe.
- As for returns, shareholders benefit twice when a business is doing well: they
  get dividends as their part of the company's profits, and the value of the shares
  goes up so that when they sell they get capital appreciation as well.

<h2 id="Chap-2">💷 Chapter 2: <i>What are bonds and gilts?</i></h2>

### Bonds

These are certificates of lending to corporation. Bonds are tradable, and as mentioned,
are long-term debt issues with an undertaking to pay regular interest (normally
at a rate fixed at the time of issue) and generally with a specified redemption
date when the issuer will buy the paper back.

### Permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs)

- Pibs are share issued by building societies that behave like bonds (or subordinated
  debt).
- They pay a fixed rate and have no stated redemption date, though some do have a
  range of dates when the issuer can (but need not) buy them back.
- Sometimes, instead of being redeemed they are switched to a floating-rate note.
- If the level of interest rates in the economy rises then the price of Pibs will fall.

### Loan stocks and debentures

- Bonds  that  have  no  specified  asset  to  act  as  security  are  called  ‘loan  
  stocks’ or ‘notes’.
- Dividends are on these bonds come regularly, irrespectuve of the state of the
  company's fortunes.
- The market prive of the paper will go up when the interest rates are coming down &
  vice versa.
- In other words, the investment return from buying bonds at any particular moment
  is governed more by the prevailing interest rates than by the state of the business
  issuing them. <!--End of page 8, start page 9-->
