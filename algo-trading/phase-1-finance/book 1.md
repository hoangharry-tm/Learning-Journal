<h2 id="Chap-1">🐣 Chapter 1: <i>What and why are shares?</i></h2>

- _Quoted shares_ are shares of the company that are published on stock exchange.
- The companies described as _blue chip_ are the largest, safest businesses on the
  stock market. Regardless, they're not completely safe.
- As for returns, shareholders benefit twice when a business is doing well: they
  get dividends as their part of the company's profits, and the value of the shares
  goes up so that when they sell they get capital appreciation as well.

<h2 id="Chap-2">💷 Chapter 2: <i>What are bonds and gilts?</i></h2>

### Bonds

These are certificates of lending to corporation. Bonds are tradable, and as mentioned,
are long-term debt issues with an undertaking to pay regular interest (normally
at a rate fixed at the time of issue) and generally with a specified redemption
date when the issuer will buy the paper back.

### Permanent interest-bearing shares (Pibs)

- Pibs are share issued by building societies that behave like bonds (or subordinated
  debt).
- They pay a fixed rate and have no stated redemption date, though some do have a
  range of dates when the issuer can (but need not) buy them back.
- Sometimes, instead of being redeemed they are switched to a floating-rate note.
- If the level of interest rates in the economy rises then the price of Pibs will fall.

### Loan stocks and debentures

- Bonds  that  have  no  specified  asset  to  act  as  security  are  called  ‘loan
  stocks’ or ‘notes’.
- Dividends are on these bonds come regularly, irrespectuve of the state of the
  company's fortunes.
- The market prive of the paper will go up when the interest rates are coming down &
  vice versa.
- In other words, the investment return from buying bonds at any particular moment
  is governed more by the prevailing interest rates than by the state of the business
  issuing them. 
- If the issuer defaults on the guaranteed interest payments - which is genereally
  only when the business is in serious danger of collapse - debenture holders can
  appoint their own receiver to realize the assets that act as their security and so
  repay them the capital. Unsecured loan stock holders have no such option _but_ still
  rank ahead of shareholders for the remnants when the compnay goes __burst__.
  
### Warrants

- Provide the right to buy ordinary shares at a predetermined price, known as the
  'exercise' or 'strike' price.
- The price of the warrents = the market price of the share - the strike price
- For instance, if the share stands at 100p and the cost of converting the warrants
  into ordinary shares has been set at 80p, the sensible price for the warrants
  would be 20p. If the share price now rises to 200p, the right price for the
  warrant would be 120p (deducting the cost of 80p for converting to share). As
  the result, when the share price doubled the warrant price jumped six-fold.

### Preference shares

- Can be considered a sort of _hybrid_
- They give holders similar rights as ordinary shares (equities), but do not have
  a vote at meetings; like bonds they get specified payments at predetermined dates.
- Holders are entitled to a dividend regardless of the company profit (gain/loss).
- __NO__ dividend is allowed to be paid on ordinary shared until the preference
  holders have had theirs.
- Have conversion rights attached, which means they can be changed into ordinary
  shares
  
### Convertibles
  
- Some _Preference shares_ [⇲](#preference-shares) and some _corporate bonds_
  [⇲](#bonds) are convertible, which essentially means there exists a _fixed date_
  when they can be transformed into ordinary shares.
- Being bonds or preference shares with an __embedded__ call option, the value is
  a mixture of the share price and hence the cost of conversion, and the income
  they generate.
  
### Gilts (Trái phiếu chính phủ)

- Although gilts are a form of _loan stock_ not specifically backed by any asset,
  the country as a whole is assumed to stand behind the issue and therefore default
  on future gilt is pretty unlikely as well - the risk is reckoned to be effectively
  zero.
- The issues have a fixed rate of interest (called "coupon") and a stated redemption 
  date when the Treasury will buy back the paper.
- The _coupon_ is determined by both the prevailing interest rates at the time and
  who the specific issue is aimed at.
